# portfolio
My first version of portfolio coded by HTML &amp; CSS.

Here is the link what the portfolio looks like.  This is my first attempt make github website for the first time.

Currently adding projects to the portfolio soon.  Most of my old projects are on Codepen which I will add the links on the portfolio.  Most of the projects were the ideas from the Freecodecamp while I was working on Front-End Certificate.
